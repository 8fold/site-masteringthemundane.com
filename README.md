# 8fold Mastering the Mundane for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP

This website is for the individual coaching practice of [Josh Bruce](https://joshbruce.com) called [Mastering the Mundane](https://mastering-the-mundane.com).

This repository is a public display of [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com), [Evolutionary Architecture](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/decoder/e/evolutionary-architecture), and a loose interpretation of [Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)).

## Installation

1. [Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Start a locally hosted PHP web server (these instructions will use a free third-party application)
	1. Download [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) (not available for Unix or Linux)
	2. Install and launch MAMP
	3. Click preferences
	4. Click server
	5. Change the root directory to `/path/to/site-mastering-the-mundane.com/site-root/public` (or local, if available)
	6. Click OK
	7. Click Start (upper right on macOS or start servers on Windows)
	8. Your default browser should automatically launch, displaying a MAMP marketing page
	9. Remove everything after `/MAMP` in the URL and hit Enter

You should see the same Mastering the Mundane website that you could find on the public web. Not only that, but you should be able to navigate around just like you would on the public web.

## Contributing

If you feel so inclined to contribute back to improving the codebase, please do so.

Note: For now, you can push directly to `main` as well. However, if things start going pear-shaped because we aren't operating in a pair-shaped manner, we'll need to enforce [short-lived branches](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/short-lived-feature-branches/) and [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Also, watching the first 8m 30s of [this talk](https://youtu.be/jeX4fan9xHI?t=173) should help.

## Details

It feels like we, the web development community, have a fair amount of limiting beliefs when it comes to web design and development. I'm sure part of that is on me and what I get exposed to. I'm sure it's also reinforced due to working with certain clients.
