As a coach, people basically pay me for what I call ethical social engineering.

In this context, social engineering by itself is deceiving and manipulating one or more people to get what *I* want. That's *not* ethical—that's exploitation. 

So, I added "ethical" to modify that script a bit.

Ethical social engineering is manipulating one or more people, their environment, or both so they get or can pursue what *they* want.

To use other terms: My joy comes from the joy of others.

Let's unpack the "manipulation" piece because there's often baggage there. Disregarding the intent of the person doing it, manipulation is somewhat amoral. You manipulate your phone. You manipulate a mouse to operate a keyboard. That sorta thing.

This brings us to marketing and sales and why I suck at it.

In the real world, most advertising I see tilts toward one or more of the following:

1. scarcity and exclusivity,
2. inferiority and elitism,
3. hype,
4. fear, and
5. desire and to be desired.

"Limited time," "While supplies last," and "Only available to listeners of this podcast" are all about scarcity and exclusivity. "Do you want to learn how to be a *real*..." is an example of inferiority and elitism. "This will change your life!" is hype. "Don't lose your house, act now" or even just "What are you afraid of?" feeds on fear. Desire can be tricky when it comes to language, but it's the whole "[Your romantic preference] will want you more if..."

It's manipulation that tilts toward exploitation. That said, it works from the perspective it causes people to reach out or at least consider buying the thing being marketed, and if it manages to do what's advertised, great! That said, if it doesn't, there are a fair number of places that don't offer refunds, and a non-trivial number of us don't take advantage of the ones who do when we're not satisfied.

I worked at a company selling the installation of home security systems. I was one of the salespeople. They used a call center to do the cold-calling and set up appointments. We were "the closers." I only sold one alarm out of dozens of interviews, and only a few people who were actually home at the established time. 

There was another salesperson who was raking in big checks. I asked how they managed to do it. Their reply did not give me much hope for humanity: "I say whatever I need to. If they have a daughter, she's gonna get raped by someone breaking into the house. Expensive cars are gonna be stolen. Both, I'll tell them both. And I bring newspaper articles with me saying such."

This is fear-based marketing and manipulation—exploitation.

Statistically speaking, there aren't a lot of people breaking into homes. Of those that do get broken into, very few humans are harmed in the process; often, no one's even home.

Anyway, I thought I'd be good at sales because when I worked in retail, I was pretty good at sales. But I didn't "sell" anything. After the experience with the alarm company, I got to thinking about why the two experiences were so different:

1. People came to me. If they weren't looking to buy something or at least learn about something, they wouldn't be there.
2. My paycheck didn't depend on me making a sale. So, I had little incentive to get them to buy something more than they needed.

I was actually able to start a small side hustle setting up people's computers (before Geek Squad and similar services existed) because people just liked working with me.

So, why am I saying all this?
